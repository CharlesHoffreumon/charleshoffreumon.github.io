			    <h3>How does Technology Diffuse?</h3>
			    <p>Generally, in S-shaped function.</p>
			    <p>Formally, we can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function">Generalised Logistic Function</a>: \[Y(t) = \frac{K}{(C+Qe^{-Bt})^{\frac{1}{\nu}}}\]</p>
			    <p class="fragment">Our paper (Hoffreumon and Labhard, 2021) proposes a way to estimate the parameters to forecast or nowcast it using Bayesian Hierarchical Models.</p>

			    <h3>Our proposed way of estimating</h3>
			    <div style="display: inline-flex; flex-wrap: wrap;  justify-items: center;">
			      <div style="width: 50%;">
				<ul>
				  <li>Simple model with only countries and technology "effects"</li>
				  <li>We infer parameters for unknown countries or unknown technologies using hierarchical priors</li>
				  <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">It works surprisingly well for such a simple model</li>

				<h4>They buy it...</h4>
				<ul>
				  <li><b>Suppliers</b> develop AI solutions and sell them to firms that integrate it to their systems.</li>
				  <li>It is important to have <b>a few highly skilled</b> workers to produce the systems that will be distributed.</li>
				</ul>
			      </div>
			      <div class="fragment" style="width: 50%">
				<h4>... and/or they make it</h4>
				<ul>
				  <li><b>Every firm</b> develop their own AI software tailor-made for their specific use case.</li>
				  <li>It is important to train <b>a large number</b> of professionals able to create new AI systems.</li>

			    <h3>The answer to the question is therefore complex</h3>
			    <ul>
			      <li>In general, AI knowledge needs to be diffused (because of complementarity and demand of some sectors).</li>
			      <li>Need more exploration of the reason why some firms prefer some sourcing strategy.</li>
			      <li>There are some market dynamics.</li>

			      <li>48.590.361 online job postings from the US</li>
			      <li>Info about the profile of the job as well as the advertised wage.</li>
			      <li>Bias towards white-collar jobs (but likely not an issue considering the questions)</li>

			    <h3>We find that no-code, low-code AI mostly benefits business specialists rather than IT specialists</h3>
			    <div class="r-stack" style="max-height: 60vh;">
			    <ul>
			      <li>The effect of no-code, low-code AI on advertised wage is distinct (lower) from the one for programmatic AI</li>
			      <li>The increase in wage from possessing no-code, low-code AI skill is higher for business and finance operation professional than from mathematics and computer science specialists.</li>

			    <h3>Where does that leave us?</h3>
			    <ol>
			      <li>Technology diffusion is mostly a predictable phenomenon on the short run. Probabilistic forecast open the way for interesting possibilities.</li>
			      <li class="fragment">To face the demand for AI, we cannot simply invest in specialists. We should <b>also</b> make sure that (IT) professionals are retrained.</li>
			      <li class="fragment">There is a middle way between highly technical AI accessible only to specialists and asking things to ChatGPT. This middle way benefits business specialists more than technical experts.</li>
			    </ol>
			  </section>
			  <section>
			    <h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>
			    <ol>
			      <li>Understand and categorise better what AI is and how it is applied.</li>
			      <li class="fragment">Understand better how it is put to productive use. What works and not. Where does it deliver value and for whom.</li>
			      <li class="fragment">How can AI techniques be applied to do better research in economics? Can we have the precision of AI with the explainability and guarantees from econometrics?</li>
			    </ol>

			    <h3>Let's finish in style with two quotes from Schumpeter</h3>
			    <div class="fragment custom disappears">
			      “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.” 
			    </div>
			    <div class="fragment custom appears">			      
“Analysis, whether economic or other, never yields more than a statement about the tendencies present in an observable pattern. And these never tell us what will happen to the pattern but only what would happen if they continued to act as they have been acting in the time interval covered by our observation and if no other factors intruded. “Inevitability” or “necessity” can never mean more than this.”
